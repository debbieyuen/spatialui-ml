# CoreML and CreateML Models for visionOS 2
This repository consists of a collection of machine learning models used in the project, Squiggly. Files include CreateML project files, CoreML files compatible for visionOS 2, and reference objects trained on 3D objects. The models selected and created here were intended for rapid prototyping and research demostrations. 

## Getting Started 
Clone the repository (or fork the repository)
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/debbieyuen/spatialui-ml.git
```

Open the CreateML project to investigate how the 3D models were trained. Try training your own 3D model. Then, export your output as a `.mlpackage`.
